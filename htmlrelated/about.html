    <h2>In depth description</h2>

    <p>Our project, LastCall, is a reminder and document tracking app designed to help people, especially young adults, stay on 
    top of deadlines they often forget.</p><p> Whether it's walking around with an expired ID or missing an important school assignment, 
    we are creating LastCall to solve that.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Users will be able to upload documents with expiry dates, input assignment deadlines, and track important personal 
    and vehicle-related documents (like insurance, car registration, lease renewals, etc.). Basically, the app is for everything 
    you need to remember but always forget.</p>
    <p>Our goal is to then send reminders to our users about those deadlines and expiry dates
    as well as to allow them to see in a dashboard-style view all upcoming deadlines and expiry dates in one place</p>
    <br>
    <p>This application is going to cater to a lot of young people, with an age range of approximately 17-30 years old. 
    These people are juggling school, work, and life in general. In a society where everything has an expiration date or a due date, 
    this app becomes not just usefulâ€”but essential for young people with busy schedules.
    Users can organize their reminders into easy-to-navigate categories such as:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Assignements</li>
        <li>Personal Documents (like IDs and passports)</li>
        <li>Vehicle & Home (e.g., car insurance, lease agreements, maintenance reminders)</li>
    </ul>
